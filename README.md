# CCarleyPlus

CCarleyPlus is a language inspired by Lua , JavaScript , C++.

It has a fast compiler faster than Lua, LuaJIT and close times to C. CCarleyPlus allows the developer to allocate memory before usage, This makes it so anything you write will not cause to error due to memory allocation errors. String functions & Math functions are made easier.


# Usage

CCarleyPlus relies heavily on type checking similar to Type-Script, Currently the compiler is not available to the public however the compiler will come out late 2023,

# Example

```sh
print::output -> (String: "f");
```
`print::output` is used to display the variable in the output, once you define the function you must include a STRING , INT. Semicolons is a need in this language which is the breakpoint.
